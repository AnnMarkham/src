<!--This is an event happening to html elements and running JavaScript cpmd wjem the event happens
Note - This is JavaScript attachet to an HTML event attribute. it is outside of the scritp tag

Event attributes are the old way responding to events in html. mostly because combining html and javascript 
makes code more difficult to maintain. Also they run in global scope which makes them tricky. and it isn't
possible to listen for multiple events using these attributes-->
